# BookClub
 WinForms BookClub application

This is an (eternally?) unfinished application used to refresh myself on Winforms and DevExpress development. It allows users to create meetings, books, locations, and to recommend new books for consideration at the next meeting. For storage, it uses a SQL Server database (see Sql folder).
